Changed the way lua scripts are referenced in formulas. Now they are input as any other string formula,
    like this: \"@lua("script_name.lua", 1)
    being 1 if the reference should be added to the depgraph or not, making it evaluated just once or
    every time the depgraph is evaluated.
    NOTE that if set to 0 and the cell is referenced by another cell, it will be executed nonetheless.

Added new exec_lua configuration variable.

Added EvalRange() so that the graph is not evaluated entirely all the time.
Replaced 'EvalAll' with 'EvalRange'.
Removed unneeded parameters on EvalJustVertex"
Added eval_order in EvalRange and rebuild_graph

import mkd files

The save format for :w command would be according to current file format. #493

EXPR and NUMBER colors were overloaded by STRING color #546

+ modified savefile() of file.c to check current file format before saving a file.
Keep consistent with other format such as csv and save the file with the same format as current file.

renamed GRID_PAIR to GRID_EVEN in color.c

Added HELP_HIGHLIGHT definition color for help page



Pending for v0.8.2 release
----------------------------

+ Add to (or check the text in) doc file:
    @getent
    @sum(A0:@getent(@lastrow,0)) examples
    Add @dts / @now to doc
    @coltoa

*CSV load/import time improvements (noticeable in large files).

*Fix in csv import (isnumeric function).
*Fix when circular reference occurs:
 Before it put @ERR in expression.
 Now it preserves the var that makes the circular reference in the formula,
 but keeps the "ERROR" label in the ent.
 ERR errors propagate to other ents.
*Changes when an ent referenced by other ents is removed:
 Before, @ERR was set whereever the reference to a removed ent exists.
 Now, if an ent is removed because of:
    1. a dr dc sh sk command,
    is_deleted flag is set on those ents.
    eval return 0 for those cases, and CELLREF is put in e->op.
    2. 'x' command, flag is_deleted is not set.
    eval return 0 for those cases as well.
 REF and ERR errors propagate to other ENDS. 
 Another change: Now when deleting a cell, if they are referenced by others, vertex is not removed.
 (is_deleted ents shall always go to freeents to be reused..)
